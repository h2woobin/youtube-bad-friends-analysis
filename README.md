# Youtube Algorithm Analysis Project

## Overview 
These days, I’ve been thinking a lot about when and why people feel emotionally supported—especially through online content. Personally, I find myself spending a lot of time on YouTube, sometimes feeling emotionally connected to the creators or comforted by their videos. I’ve even considered starting my own YouTube channel someday. But before jumping in, I want to better understand how YouTubers become successful and what kinds of videos truly resonate with viewers.

The goal of this project is to analyze the YouTube podcast channel Bad Friends to understand the key factors behind its audience growth and emotional resonance. By studying video metadata (e.g., titles, thumbnails, upload timing, video length) and audience reactions (through comment sentiment and keyword analysis), I aim to uncover what makes this channel engaging, relatable, and successful.

Eventually, this project will serve as a foundation to develop a reusable analysis framework that can be applied to other YouTube channels. The long-term vision is to help aspiring creators—or myself—understand what makes content emotionally effective and audience-centric.


## Project Plan
### Step 1: Channel Selection & Motivation
Selected **Bad Friends** YouTube podcast channel featuring Bobby Lee and Andrew Santino.
Reason for selection: Consistently high viewer engagement, emotionally expressive fanbase, and strong creator-viewer connection through humor and vulnerability.

### Step 2: Data Collection
Collect video metadata using the YouTube API or scraping tools:
- Video titles
- Upload dates
- Thumbnails
- Video length
- Number of views, likes, and comments

Collect top comments from 20–30 videos for emotional keyword analysis.

### Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyze distribution of:

Title lengths and common keywords

Thumbnail characteristics (color tone, presence of hosts, facial expressions)

Upload frequency and timing

Video length trends

Visualize view count vs. video features

### Step 5: Pattern Recognition & Modeling
Quantify key video features and emotional response scores

Explore clustering or classification models:
Predict whether a video will receive strong emotional support based on metadata
Cluster similar video types based on engagement and comment sentiment

### Step 6: Reflection & Future Application
Summarize findings: What makes Bad Friends so emotionally engaging?
Consider how these insights could apply to future YouTube content creation
Build a reusable analysis pipeline for other channels
